## Redesigning the docuementation

**Priority:** High

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Strong contribution to Sugar and its Activities, in order to know how they work
 - Strong Knowledge of the community and what do we do apart from code, in order to update content.
 - Experince with writing documentation, preferably for Sugar Labs

**Desciption**<br>
In terms of content, we have the [Wiki](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome_to_the_Sugar_Labs_wiki), [GitHub Documentation](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs), [Sugar Toolkit Documentation](https://developer.sugarlabs.org/sugar3/), [Documentation inside Sugar](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/tree/master/docs) and possibly more. The content is not streamlined, and some of it is incomplete, interdependent across services, outdated or duplicated. All this makes it difficult for beginners to understand the community and contribute.<br>
There is scope for adding new docuementation as well. Eg: the code for [Sugar](https://www.github.com/sugarlabs/sugar) is hardly documented.<br>
The intended audience for the content can vary from developers to students, teachers, translators, designers and many more.

To curb this:
 - [ ] Design a clear scope for each of the services used, to avoid duplicity and intermixing of content
 - [ ] Migrate the content in accordance with the decided scope
 - [ ] Remove / update outdated and duplicated content.
 - [ ] Add new documentation wherever required.
 - [ ] Improve existing documentation wherever possible.
